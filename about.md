Hi, I'm Jamal 👋🏽

I'm a Computer Scientist, amateur game developer, and Machine Learning advocate.

🔭 I’m currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Captify](https://www.captify.co.uk), building out NLP & IR systems, and developing our semantic understanding of search data.

🌱 My AI passions are fundamentally split between NLP & Information retrieval, and AI for simulation. I'm a sucker for AI applications in interactive media, simulating the social sciences, and procedural generation.

💻 You'll probably find me playing in Unity, testing game mechanic ideas!

Catch me on [Github](https://github.com/jamalrahman) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamal-rahman/)!
