I'm Jamal - a British Computer Scientist, amateur cook, and overall tech enthusiast.

My field is Machine Learning. I engineer systems that bring Machine Learning to the forefront across numerous industries. I've previously worked at IBM, but currently you'll find me building NLP & Information Retrieval systems at [Captify](https://www.captify.co.uk).

I write here about Computer Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and more.
