I'm Jamal - a British Computer Scientist, amateur cook, and overall tech enthusiast.

I'm a full-stack Machine Learning Engineer. I love building interesting and innovative platforms from inception to delivery; delving through state of the art research to engineering robust training pipelines and MLOps architectures. I've previously worked at IBM, but currently you'll find me building NLP & Information Retrieval systems at [Captify](https://www.captify.co.uk).

I write here about Computer Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and more.
